Sentiment Analysis using Twitter Data

Abstract

This study focuses on using Twitter data analysis to categorise sentiment in tweets that contain text. Sorting tweets into categories like "Irrelevant," "Negative," "Neutral," or "Positive" is the issue at hand. The tweets in the dataset have been assigned the appropriate sentiment categories. Preprocessing methods such column renaming, removing extraneous characteristics, and categorical value encoding were used. Techniques including regular expression removal, stopword deletion, and stemming were used to handle text data. The CountVectorizer was then used to turn the text into numerical characteristics. Accuracy scores were used to train and assess a number of classification models, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine. The model with the highest accuracy, 87.29 percent, was Random Forest. It is possible to categorise sentiment in fresh input text using the trained models. This study shows how text categorization methods perform well when used for sentiment analysis tasks.



Conclusion

We effectively tackled the issue of sentiment classification in Twitter data in this study. We obtained encouraging outcomes by preprocessing the text data and utilising machine learning methods. With an accuracy of 87.29%, the Random Forest model surpassed other classifiers. This shows how well ensemble approaches handle challenges including sentiment analysis. The trained models can be used to automatically classify tweets into sentiment categories, which can reveal insightful information about trends in sentiment and public opinion. The importance of text preparation methods and machine learning algorithms in comprehending and assessing sentiment in social media data is highlighted by this study.
